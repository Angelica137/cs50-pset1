My frist time coding C

These programs require the cs50 library to run.

### Hello

A simple greeting with user input

### Mario

An algorithm to create pyramids using user input

### Credit card

Write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein. Your program’s last line of output should be AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n. For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric.
